Welcome to my Data Analyst Journey!
This repository serves as a record of my learning process as I embark on my journey to becoming a data analyst. Inside, you'll find various projects, experiments, and resources that showcase my growth and understanding of this exciting field.

My goal is to use this space to:

Document my learning: By logging my projects, I can track my progress, reflect on mistakes, and identify areas for improvement.
Share my work: I want to contribute to the data science community and learn from others by sharing my projects and inviting feedback.
Stay motivated: Having a public record of my progress helps me stay accountable and motivated to keep learning and exploring.
What you'll find here:

Data analysis projects: This will include hands-on exercises, Kaggle competitions, and personal projects showcasing my skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and modeling.
Jupyter notebooks: Most projects will be documented using Jupyter notebooks, allowing you to see the code and execution process.
Learning resources: I'll share links to tutorials, courses, and articles that have been helpful for my learning.
Readme files: Each project will have a dedicated readme file with details about the data, task, and approach used.
I'm still early in my learning journey, but I'm excited to share my progress and connect with other aspiring data analysts. Feel free to explore, ask questions, and provide feedback!
